It nearly reached the same level as it was at during the 2007-2008 Food Price Crisis.\n\n• World Bank President warns that the world is \"one shock away from a global crisis\"\n\n• The situation began with poor weather conditions (excessive rains, floods, etc.) in farming countries such as Australia and China among others for important crops such as wheat. After that, export restrictions and limited supply drove demand for alternative cereals up thus increasing the price of all commodities.\n\n• The World Bank estimates that 44 million people fell into poverty (less than $1.25/day) as a result of this price increase. Poverty is directly linked with hunger and developmental deficiencies especially in children.\n\n• Additionally, malnutrition became more prevalent, particularly affecting vulnerable segments of the population such as infants and pregnant women.\nIn all, this event underscores the poor's vulnerability to climate change and its unequal access to food.\n\n• Source No.(s): 4, 29",

For example, a plant engineer states, “The rule of thumb in processing potatoes is that 50 percent of the potato goes out the back door as finished product.”\n\t\t§ Food is usually discarded past the sell-by date \n\t○ Retail\n\t\t§ A 2008 estimate states that 10% of total food in the US is lost at the retail stage.\n\t\t§ Customers cull food based on looks, and only select the ones that look \"perfect\"\n\t\t§ Waste is viewed as a sign of customer satisfaction and quality control. If lots of food is thrown away, then poor-quality items are removed and there is sufficient supply.\n\t○ Households\n\t\t§ Poor storage leading to spoilage of food\n\t\t§ Confusion over the term \"best by\" and \"use by\", both of which refer to peak performance, not necessarily food safety. The UK's Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme estimates that 20% of household food is thrown away in this manner.\n\n• Several comparisons are made, and show how the developed world is wasting food at the consumer level at an order of magnitude higher than the developing world.\n\n• Overall, these inefficiencies generate billions of dollars of loss annually for the United States, and show how hunger is a logistics problem, not a production problem.\n\n• Source No.(s): 14\n",

For example, many have banned GM products, and some only legalize specific strains of GM crops.\n\n• Proponents of GM highlight its advantageous properties such as pest resistance and macronutrient supplementation. For example, \"golden rice\" is a strain of rice that contains Vitamin A, which does not occur naturally in rice.\n\n• Opponents, following the \"precautionary principle\", are skeptical of purported claims that GM crops will not taint nature's genetic pool or cause adverse health effects in humans.  \n\n• Current research indicates that there are no health concerns from GM crops.\n\n• Some advocate center and support both increasing GM crop testing and its usage. \n\n• In summary, an important debate is raised about a potential way to provide the world's population using technology. This could have potential ramification for technology's ability to aid future food production.\n\n• Source No.(s): 12\n",

He states that targeted advertising are giving parents and children the wrong message. Children look up to their stars, and see them eating fast food. As a result, they do the same (1).\n\n• In general, the increase in consumption of fats and sugars have also caused a corresponding increase in the prevalence of obesity.\n\n• Obesity is linked to further non-communicable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and has potential implications for the future of this generation.\n\n• Overall, this shows that the food problem spans the entire spectrum ranging from malnutrition and chronic hunger in low-income countries to obesity and food waste in high-income countries. It means that a sustainable future must have not only sufficient quantities of food, but also sufficient quality of food.\n\n• Sources: 1, 2, 24",

Agribusiness and fracking industries, together accounting for over 90% of the state's water use, still remain unaffected by legislation aimed at reducing water usage (15).\n\n• There's a clear disparity between a corporation's effect on the environment and their responsibility for it, as shown by how individual residents are punished if they \"waste water\" when the amount they use is minuscule compared to agribusiness and bottling companies.\nIn all, California serves as an important case study on the influence of corporations in policy and how the issues of water and food are political in nature.\n\n• Source No.(s): 5, 15, 22, 28\n",

Someone else pay, not me!\n\t\n• Turns out, \"someone\" is misleading. It's everyone that pays. Your citizens breathe polluted air. They eat unhealthy food laden with pesticides. Your most opportunity-deprived people go hungry while companies use nature like it's free (34).\n\t\n• This is why, as a government, you need to increase the barriers to nature. Tying in with the concept of incentives, the complement is punishments.\n\t\n• Carbon Tax is one possible solution, in which entities pay for the pollution they emit. Others include tax rebates for those who engage in some level of sustainability practices. However, a general solution should be a comprehensive environmental law that ensures that companies do not use nature recklessly.\n\t\n• As a government, you have the ability to take charge of your own country. This would bring us closer to the sustainable farming and healthy eating which should be common in the 21st century today.\n\n• Source No.(s): 34\n\n",
