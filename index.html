It nearly reached the same level as it was at during the 2007-2008 Food Price Crisis.\n\n• World Bank President warns that the world is \"one shock away from a global crisis\"\n\n• The situation began with poor weather conditions (excessive rains, floods, etc.) in farming countries such as Australia and China among others for important crops such as wheat. After that, export restrictions and limited supply drove demand for alternative cereals up thus increasing the price of all commodities.\n\n• The World Bank estimates that 44 million people fell into poverty (less than $1.25/day) as a result of this price increase. Poverty is directly linked with hunger and developmental deficiencies especially in children.\n\n• Additionally, malnutrition became more prevalent, particularly affecting vulnerable segments of the population such as infants and pregnant women.\nIn all, this event underscores the poor's vulnerability to climate change and its unequal access to food.",

For example, a plant engineer states, “The rule of thumb in processing potatoes is that 50 percent of the potato goes out the back door as finished product.”\n\t\t§ Food is usually discarded past the sell-by date \n\t○ Retail\n\t\t§ A 2008 estimate states that \t\t                      10% of total food in the US is lost at the retail stage.\n\t\t§ Customers cull food based on looks, and only select the ones that look \"perfect\"\n\t\t§ Waste is viewed as a sign of customer satisfaction and quality control. If lots of food is thrown away, then poor-quality items are removed and there is sufficient supply.\n\t○ Households\n\t\t§ Poor storage leading to spoilage of food\n\t\t§ Confusion over the term \"best by\" and \"use by\", both of which refer to peak performance, not necessarily food safety. The UK's Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme estimates that 20% of household food is thrown away in this manner.\n\n• Several comparisons are made, and show how the developed world is wasting food at the consumer level at an order of magnitude higher than the developing world.\n\n• Overall, these inefficiencies generate billions of dollars of loss annually for the United States, and show how hunger is a logistics problem, not a production problem.",
